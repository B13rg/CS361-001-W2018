\subsection{Progress Made this Week}

This week we worked on getting the different parts of assignment 4 together and assembling the presentation.  We worked on solidifying the design patterns and strategy to make them clearer for both us the programmers and the customer.  We started thinking about direct coding decisions when it came to handling different types of exceptions that may come up.  Additionally we compacted everything into a slide show and practiced presenting in preparation for either tuesday or thursday.

\subsection{Plans for Next Week}

Next we will start nailing down individual user stories for different actions that a user can do.  This will include making a post, voting on a post, fetching a posts or moderating posts.  This will enable us to better plan how to implement these features.  We will also start preparing to program by setting up the toolchain and agreeing on a coding style.
