\section{User Story}
      \subsection{Add a post}
      The server side group worked on adding this ability to the api.  Currently a user is able to POST a json string to the server.  The server takes the json and decodes a post object out of it.  Then the post is passed into the database to be retrieved later.  Implimentation of this took 2 hours.  Currently we still need to test the implimentation with more extensive unit tests.      
      \subsection{Add a Comment}
      The server side group worked on adding this ability to the api.  Currently a user is able to POST a json string to the server.  The server takes the json and decodes a comment object out of it.  Then the post is passed into the database to be retrieved later.  Implimentation of this took 1 hour.  It was extremely similar to adding a post.  Currently we still need to test the implimentation with more extensive unit tests.
      \subsection{Like/Dislike}
      The server side group implimentated a way to like and dislike posts.  It is done by throwing a 1 or a 0 to the url of the post.  This will look like this: https://Talkatiel.com/Posts/<int:postID>/<int:voteType> .  The server decodes the url and applies the proper vote to the given post.  Implimentation took around 3 hours.  Currently there needs to be more testing done.
