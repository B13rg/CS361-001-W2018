\section{Product Release} \subsection{Server Side Implementation} Currently the
server code can be downloaded and run locally.  By cloning the repository
located at\begin{verbatim} https://github.com/B13rg/Talkatiel_API.git
\end{verbatim}one can run the server.  There is also extensive documentation
detailing all the steps that need to be taken to run the server.  There is also
a SQL script that will create a database when run.  This can be used to create a
database for use on a different engine.  Currently it is configured to run on
the localhost on port 5002.  This can be tested to navigating to
\begin{verbatim}127.0.0.1:5002/Posts/New \end{verbatim}where you can see the raw
Json output of a post.  In the repository there is also an sqlite database that
is run alongside the python code.  This will connect with the python to respond
to different sql queries.  It is fully functioning, and the only thing left to
do is test it, and find a permanent URL. By midweek, we plan to start permanent
hosting with google app engine.

\section{Design Changes and Rationale}

\section{Refactoring}

    Our project is still being developed in parts. For the most part, we have been working towards building a working application and database, and slowly cleaning up as we go. This has lead to some sloppy, duplicate code. However, we have been making progress building. Once one of our members has completed his/her section, while waiting for others to complete, they have cleaned up their code and make it easier to follow. While this isn’t a top priority right now, we believe that refactoring our code as we complete files will help us in the future. It will also allow us to switch duties and work on each other's code without too much confusion.

    We ended up doing minor refactoring. While working on the client side development, we ended up making templates for common, reoccurring elements. This has been useful while developing other parts of the application, when attempting to make the styling similar. We have been able to remain somewhat consistent.

    In addition to these changes, we have also changed variable names before committing to the shared repository. This helps those who are viewing changes follow along. Many of us have been saving files offline before pushing, forcing us to correct changes before pushing. By doing this, we are not stressed to push our work as a simple “backup” of our work. Saving and updating locally/remotely before pushing to a shared repo has helped us stay consistent and organized.

    Making these changes has helped us stay organized and also limit the “turnover” time between switching parts and tasks. For instance, when two people switched files to review code, we were able to follow along much easier when the code was simplified.
