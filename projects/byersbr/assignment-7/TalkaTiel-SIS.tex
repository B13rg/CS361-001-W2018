\section{Product Release}
\subsection{Server Side Implementation} Currently the server code can be
downloaded and run locally.  By cloning the repository located
at\begin{verbatim} https://github.com/B13rg/Talkatiel_API.git \end{verbatim}one
can run the server.  There is also extensive documentation detailing all the
steps that need to be taken to run the server.  There is also a SQL script that
will create a database when run.  This can be used to create a database for use
on a different engine.  Currently it is configured to run on the localhost on
port 5002.  This can be tested to navigating to
\begin{verbatim}127.0.0.1:5002/Posts/New \end{verbatim}where you can see the raw
Json output of a post.  In the repository there is also an sqlite database that
is run alongside the python code.  This will connect with the python to respond
to different sql queries.  It is fully functioning, and the only thing left to
do is test it, and find a permanent URL. By midweek, we plan to start permanent
hosting with google app engine.
