\section{Product Release} \subsection{Server Side Implementation} Currently the
server code can be downloaded and run locally.  By cloning the repository
located at\begin{verbatim} https://github.com/B13rg/Talkatiel_API.git
\end{verbatim}one can run the server.  There is also extensive documentation
detailing all the steps that need to be taken to run the server.  There is also
a SQL script that will create a database when run.  This can be used to create a
database for use on a different engine.  Currently it is configured to run on
the localhost on port 5002.  This can be tested to navigating to
\begin{verbatim}127.0.0.1:5002/Posts/New \end{verbatim}where you can see the raw
Json output of a post.  In the repository there is also an sqlite database that
is run alongside the python code.  This will connect with the python to respond
to different sql queries.  It is fully functioning, and the only thing left to
do is test it, and find a permanent URL. By midweek, we plan to start permanent
hosting with google app engine.
